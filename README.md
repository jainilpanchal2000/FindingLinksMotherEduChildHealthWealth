## Finding Links between Mother Education, Child Health and Socio-Economic Status
## Overview
In this project, we analyzed the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data of children under the age of five whose mothers were interviewed. The dataset contains information about the child's immunization, health, and nutrition data, as well as data for each child's mother.
Using PowerBI, we created multiple reports to gain insights from this raw NFHS survey data.

## Key Findings
After analyzing the dataset, we found several key insights:

- The percentage of non-educated mothers is highest in rural areas.
- There are no cases of a mother without education in Kerala in the latest NFHS5 survey.
- Children of non-educated mothers have a higher chance of stunting/wasting.
-  The percentage of non-educated mothers is highest in the poorest wealth index category, while the percentage of highly educated    mothers is highest in the richest wealth category.
-  The percentage of severely stunted/wasted/underweight children is highest in the poorest wealth index category.
-  The percentage of severely stunted children is highest in the NFHS3 survey.
